      <p>Who would've known what kinds of things this kid could do. This website will dive a little into what kinds of things have happened to this kid. I was born November 25th in Colton, California. </p><p> At the age of 3 went to St. George School to spend the next 10 years, working to get to high school. Along the wrong their may have been bumps and bruises. But ultimately, I had achieved the title of valedictorian for my 8th grade class. Throughout my highschool year, a lot of things have happened. There is only more to come. Working with my mother as a baker on the weekends is a hard task, and sometimes it can be frustrating. Throughout my growing years I have struggled, but onoly good can come out of struggling. I love my life and wouldnt give anything in  the world to restart. I am now enrolled in a Junior Volunteer Program at SARH, which will help educate me further in my future field of medicine. Some things about me, that most people dont know. Is that I love to game, I usually play Fortnite, or League of Legends. Both games that I enjoy very much playing with my friends on the weekends. I have one sister, who I am very close too. In the 3rd grade. I enjoy helping her with her softball practices, and shaping her into a better person.

      <p>Aspiring to be a surgeon when he is grown up first gains experience by volunteering in a hospital. Click on the Hobby Link on top, to find out more about his hobbies and how he is going about achieving his goals. I am striving to be a surgeon as some people know, and this means years of hardwork and dedication. Using the skills gained throughout my years of school I am going to enter the Field of Medicine.</p>
